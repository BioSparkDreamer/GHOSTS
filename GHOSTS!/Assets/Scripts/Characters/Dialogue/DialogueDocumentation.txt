OWEN'S DIALOGUE SCRIPTS DOCUMENTATION
=====================================

DialogueReader.cs: 
~ component added on actors
~ reads dialogue
~ intended to be game-agnostic, not specifically designed to only take our dialogue

The script takes the path of a file starting in root directory "[ProjectName]/Assets/Resources" and reads that dialogue to the screen.

=STYLE GUIDE=
* When an instance of the DialogueReader component is added to an actor, an array of actors should be declared as well, each with names, IDs, and sprites. IDs will be a single character and will be used to identify a speaker. 
- In a script, the first line must begin with an ID.
- The first line should establish a speaker. Any lines after one speaker is established will appear with the name and portrait of the previous speaker until a new one is established.
- New speakers are established by beginning a line with an Actor ID followed by a colon and a space before the line of dialogue. 
- Comments can be written by beginning a line with "/"; All characters following the '/' will be ignored until the end of the line.
- Colored text (or bolded, italicized, etc.) is written using standard HTML tags.
- One txt file should cover one conversation. Dialogue ends when the file does.
